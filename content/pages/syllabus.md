Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course is a graduate introduction to cryptography. Topics include encryption, pseudo-random generation, digital signatures, two-party protocols and zero-knowledge. The emphasis will be on proof techniques.

Prerequisites
-------------

General ease with algorithms, elementary number theory and discrete probability. If you have any questions about your background or whether you are prepared to take this course, please contact the TA.

Homework and Grading Policy
---------------------------

The grade will be based on homework assignments and class participation. You should expect roughly 8 problem sets during the term.

You are free to collaborate with other students on the homework, but you must turn in your own individually written solution and you must specify the names of your collaborators. Additionally, you may make use of published material, provided that you acknowledge all sources used. Note that it is a violation of this policy to submit a problem solution that you are unable to explain orally to a member of the course staff.

Problem sets **must** be typed. Use of LaTeX is not required but LaTeX templates will be provided. You may also be required to scribe one lecture of the course.
